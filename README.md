# KoReader Webtoons Downloader
WARNING! this code is still WIP
Also if you want to be up to date with your favourite comics i would reccomend using [rss reader](https://github.com/omer-faruq/rssreader.koplugin), cause it fetches new comics every time. This plugin on the other hand only has manual download, but allows you to save comics to read them offline, and pull all episodes, not only the latest one.

A simple plugin that allows to download webtoons from the E-reader level. It requires  a [downloader server](https://github.com/trybula/GoWebtoonApi)

### Installation
Just copy everything into the plugins folder and update your config file. Moreover you need to host your own server
